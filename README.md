### **Code Framework**
- MIL_BASELINE defines MIL models through a YAML configuration file.
- Since different MIL models may have different training logic, MIL_BASELINE defines a separate training framework for each MIL model, thus achieving decoupling.
- In addition, it provides scripts for WSI feature extraction and data partitioning, supporting feature extractors like R50 and PLIP, making expansion very convenient.
- Dataset partitioning supports the most common TVT split and Train-Test with k-fold division.
- MIL_BASELINE provides a highly convenient and easily extendable framework for research on improvements to MIL models. Thank you for your ðŸ¥‡ star.
